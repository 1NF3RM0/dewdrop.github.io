# Project Overview

This directory contains the source files for the DEW Drop Construction Company's static website. The website is designed to showcase the company's services, provide information about their operations in Marondera, Zimbabwe, and offer contact options. It is structured as a simple, client-side web application, suitable for deployment on static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Key Files

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that serves as the homepage for the DEW Drop Construction Company website. It defines the structure and content, including a header with navigation, a hero section, an "About Us" section, a "Services" section detailing painting, plumbing, tiling, and general construction, and a "Contact Us" section with a form.
*   **`style.css`**: This file contains all the CSS rules that define the visual styling and layout of the `index.html` page. It ensures a consistent and branded look for the website.
*   **`script.js`**: This JavaScript file provides interactive functionalities for the website. Currently, it includes smooth scrolling for navigation links and dynamically updates the current year in the footer.
*   **`_config.yml`**: A configuration file typically used by Jekyll, a static site generator often employed with GitHub Pages. Its specific contents would dictate how Jekyll processes the site.
*   **`README.md`**: Provides a brief, human-readable overview and description of the project.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be served as a static website.

*   **Local Viewing**: To view the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
*   **Deployment**: The website can be deployed to any static web hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or similar platforms. The `_config.yml` suggests a potential setup for GitHub Pages using Jekyll.
